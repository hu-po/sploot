# sploot

Attempting to implement 3d Gaussian Splats from scratch for fun.

### Datasets

earth images with camera coordinates?
spherical objects with unique views? easy to verify, relatively small. Does this dataset already exist or is it easy to generate? Can longitude and latitude be used as camera coordinates? longitude and latitude to quaternion?
